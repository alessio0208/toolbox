I'm pleased to announce the release of tcpflow version 1.5.0.  This
version was going to be called version 1.4.7, but so much has changed
that it seemed like a good time to bump the minor version number. It's
more than just a bug-fix release!

Changes from 1.4.6:

* We now pin to simsong/http-parser rather than nodejs/http-parser, so that we have more control over http-parser's .gitignore file.

* support for cmake. (May not be current, but it's there for you cmake fans!)

* CONFIGURE_FEDORA_26.sh script installs all needed Fedora 26 packages.

* CONFIGURE_UBUNTU_16_04.sh script installs all needed Ubuntu 16.04 packages

* CONFIGURE_ARCH_17_8.sh installs all needed Arch Linux 17.8 packages! Yes, we now support Arch!

* getopt_long() support. Now you can go to town and create long-versions of all your favorite, one-character tcpflow options (provided you know C++, of course. Please submit pull requests!)

* tcpflow man page updated

* There's a Python post-processor option as well. 

* chroot() and drop root, allowing better control of privledge. 

* Support for libcap (capability library).
